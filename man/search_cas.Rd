\format{
The following data frame of the fields to be returned are recognized:
\itemize{
\item query : family, genus, and species matched.
\item species(genus)_author : species(genus) and author(s) returned.
\item species(genus) : Species(genus) returned.
\item author : Author(s) returned.
\item family : Family(subfamily) of species.
\item status : Current status including validation, synonym, and uncertainty.
\item distribution : species distribution
\item habitat : species habitat (freshwater, brackish, marine)
}

\usage{
search_cas(query, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{\code{string} One and more queries, support family, genus, and species.}

\item{type}{\code{string} There is one required parameter, type = c("genus_family","species_family","species_genus","species").For example, `genus_family` for genera in a family,`species_family` for species in a family, `species_genus` for species in a genus, and `species` for species related to a species.}
